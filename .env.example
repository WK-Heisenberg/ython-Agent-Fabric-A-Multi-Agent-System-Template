# .env.example - Environment variables for the a2a-python-dispute-project
#
# This file serves as a template. Copy it to a new file named .env
# (`cp .env.example .env`) and customize the values for your local development environment.
# The .env file is ignored by git.
#
# These variables are primarily used when running the services individually
# (e.g., `python app/main.py`) outside of Docker Compose. The docker-compose.yml
# file has its own environment settings.
